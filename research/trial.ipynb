He was a \\ngenius, having designed and patented a key component in Wi-Fi \\nrouters in his 20s. He had started and sold several companies. He \\nwas wildly successful. \\nHe also had a relationship with money I’d describe as a mix of \\ninsecurity and childish stupidity. \\nHe carried a stack of hundred dollar bills several inches thick. \\nHe showed it to everyone who wanted to see it and many who \\ndidn’t. He bragged openly and loudly about his wealth, often \\nwhile drunk and always apropos of nothing. \\nOne day he handed one of my colleagues several thousand \\ndollars of cash and said, “Go to the jewelry store down the street \\nand get me a few $1,000 gold coins.”\\nAn hour later, gold coins in hand, the tech executive and his \\nbuddies gathered around by a dock overlooking the Pacific Ocean. \\nThey then proceeded to throw the coins into the sea, skipping them \\nlike rocks, cackling as they argued whose went furthest. Just for fun. \\nDays later he shattered a lamp in the hotel’s restaurant. A \\nmanager told him it was a $500 lamp and he’d have to replace it.'),\n",

Now get \\nout of my face. And don’t ever insult me like that again.” \\nYou may wonder how long this behavior could last, and the \\nanswer was “not long.” I learned years later that he went broke. \\nThe premise of this book is that doing well with money has a \\nlittle to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you \\nbehave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. \\nA genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial \\ndisaster. The opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financial \\neducation can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills \\nthat have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence. \\n***\\nMy favorite Wikipedia entry begins: “Ronald James Read was \\nan American philanthropist, investor, janitor, and gas station \\nattendant.”\\nRonald Read was born in rural Vermont. He was the first \\nperson in his family to graduate high school, made all the more \\nimpressive by the fact that he hitchhiked to campus each day. \\nFor those who knew Ronald Read, there wasn’t much else \\nworth mentioning. His life was about as low key as they come.  \\nRead fixed cars at a gas station for 25 years and swept floors \\nat JCPenney for 17 years. He bought a two-bedroom house for \\n$12,000 at age 38 and lived there for the rest of his life. He was \\nwidowed at age 50 and never remarried. A friend recalled that his \\nmain hobby was chopping firewood. \\nRead died in 2014, age 92. Which is when the humble rural \\njanitor made international headlines. \\n2,813,503 Americans died in 2014. Fewer than 4,000 of them \\nhad a net worth of over $8 million when they passed away. Ronald \\nRead was one of them.'),\n",

It apparently \\nturned Fuscone’s into dust. High debt and illiquid assets left \\nhim bankrupt. “I currently have no income,” he allegedly told a \\nbankruptcy judge in 2008. \\nFirst his Palm Beach house was foreclosed. \\nIn 2014 it was the Greenwich mansion’s turn. \\nFive months before Ronald Read left his fortune to charity, \\n INTRODUCTION'),\n",

It’s that \\nknowing what to do tells you nothing about what happens in \\nyour head when you try to do it. \\n***\\nTwo topics impact everyone, whether you are interested in them \\nor not: health and money. \\nThe health care industry is a triumph of modern science, with \\nrising life expectancy across the world. Scientific discoveries have \\nreplaced doctors’ old ideas about how the human body works, and \\nvirtually everyone is healthier because of it.  \\nThe money industry—investing, personal finance, business \\nplanning—is another story. \\nFinance has scooped up the smartest minds coming from top \\nuniversities over the last two decades. Financial Engineering was \\nthe most popular major in Princeton’s School of Engineering a \\ndecade ago. Is there any evidence it has made us better investors? \\nI have seen none. \\nThrough collective trial and error over the years we learned \\nhow to become better farmers, skilled plumbers, and advanced \\nchemists. But has trial and error taught us to become better with \\nour personal finances? Are we less likely to bury ourselves in \\ndebt? More likely to save for a rainy day? Prepare for retirement?'),\n",

Everyone thinks about it a little differently. It offers lessons \\non things that apply to many areas of life, like risk, confidence, \\nand happiness. Few topics offer a more powerful magnifying \\nglass that helps explain why people behave the way they do than \\nmoney. It is one of the greatest shows on Earth.\\nMy own appreciation for the psychology of money is shaped \\nby more than a decade of writing on the topic. I began writing \\nabout finance in early 2008. It was the dawn of a financial crisis \\nand the worst recession in 80 years. \\nTo write about what was happening, I wanted to figure out what \\nwas happening. But the first thing I learned after the financial \\ncrisis was that no one could accurately explain what happened, \\nor why it happened, let alone what should be done about it. For \\nevery good explanation there was an equally convincing rebuttal. \\nEngineers can determine the cause of a bridge collapse because \\nthere’s agreement that if a certain amount of force is applied to \\na certain area, that area will break. Physics isn’t controversial. \\nIt’s guided by laws. Finance is different. It’s guided by people’s \\nbehaviors. And how I behave might make sense to me but look \\ncrazy to you. \\nThe more I studied and wrote about the financial crisis, the \\nmore I realized that you could understand it better through the \\nlenses of psychology and history, not finance. \\nTo grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don’t need'),\n",
